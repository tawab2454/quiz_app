## üîë Key Understanding

Your system has TWO fields for questions:

1. **`difficulty`** = The actual difficulty: easy, medium, hard
2. **`category`** = Grouping for display: easy, medium, hard, image, video

### The Fix:
- **For difficulty-based selection (easy/medium/hard):** 
  - System now queries `WHERE difficulty = 'easy/medium/hard'`
  - This includes TEXT + VIDEO + IMAGE questions of that difficulty
  
- **For media-based selection (image/video):**
  - System queries `WHERE category = 'image/video'`
  - This gets all questions with that media type

## üìä Current Question Availability

```
EASY questions:   11 total (3 text + 8 video)
MEDIUM questions:  9 total (5 text + 4 video)  
HARD questions:    7 total (3 text + 4 video)
IMAGE questions:  12 total
VIDEO questions:  18 total
```
